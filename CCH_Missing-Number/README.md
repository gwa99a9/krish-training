# Find the Missing Number
## Write a program to find the missing number of the given sequence. Starts at random but follows n+1 and dont know the size of the sequence.
### Rules
- Cannot use built functions (get,contains,find)
- Can only have n+1 pattern
- If there is more than 1 missing number its an invalid sequence
### Assumptions
- If there is no missing number, it may have the missing number before the first number or after the last number
